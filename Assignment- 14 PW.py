Q1. What is an API? Give an example, where an API is used in real life.


# In[ ]:


A1. API is an abbreviation for Application Programming Interface which is a collection of communication protocols and 
    subroutines used by various programs to communicate between them. A programmer can make use of various API tools to
    make their program easier and simpler. Also, an API facilitates programmers with an efficient way to develop their 
    software programs. Thus in simpler terms, an API helps two programs or applications to communicate with each other by
    providing them with the necessary tools and functions. It takes the request from the user and sends it to the service
    provider and then again sends the result generated from the service provider to the desired user.

Q2. Give advantages and disadvantages of using API. 


# In[ ]:


A2. There is a lot of conveniences and advantages to APIs, but business leaders should also be aware of the disadvantages.
    As a single point of entry, an API is a gateway and can become a hacker's primary target. Once the API is compromised,
    all other applications and systems become vulnerable.

Q3. What is a Web API? Differentiate between API and Web API.


# In[ ]:


A3. APIs are application interfaces, meaning that one application is able to interact with another application in a 
    standardized way. Web services are a type of API, which must be accessed through a network connection. REST APIs are 
    a standardized architecture for building web APIs using HTTP methods.

Q4. Explain REST and SOAP Architecture. Mention shortcomings of SOAP.


# In[ ]:


A4. SOAP does not support caching API calls. SOAP is much more complicated than REST, which can have performance 
    implications. SOAP is much less adaptable than REST. SOAP is usually slower than REST.

Q5. Differentiate between REST and SOAP


# In[ ]:


A5. SOAP is a protocol. REST is an architectural style. SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol.
    REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer. SOAP can't use REST because it is a protocol. 
    REST can use SOAP web services because it is a concept and can use any protocol like HTTP, SOAP. 
    SOAP uses services interfaces to expose the business logic.
